# Steps we are following to deploy our app on AWS Elastic BeanStalk

Step1: Your main python file name should be application.py
Step2: Your flask object name, which we have defined in application.py should also be the application.
Step3: .ebignore  is responsible to hold the name of those files which we don't want to push on a cloud.
Step4: Create a requirements.txt file
        command : pip freeze > requirements.txt
Step5: Create a folder in your application and name it as .ebextensions
Step6: Inside .ebextensions we have to create a new file and name it as python.config
Step7: In python.config we are suppose to mention the below commands
         option_settings:
              "aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python":
                WSGIPath: application:application
